<name name="3-D Connective Field Modeling Toolbox" nitrc="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/r2r_prf" />
<description> A framework for both fitting and describing connectivity patterns between regions that is a simple extension from the current population receptive field models in the visual neuroscience literature. This provides a description of the specific nature of connectivity from one region to another. The connectivity from each voxel in a designated seed region to a mapping region is modeled as a 3-dimensional Gaussian, providing location parameters and spread parameters. This allows the direct description of the relative mapping from one region to another. </description>
