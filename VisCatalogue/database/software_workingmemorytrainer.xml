<description> This is a stand-alone axecutable under all main Windows OS. It is a program for training the working memory. The WM Trainer looks and behaves a little bit like a video-game and has been specifically conceived for children attending the primary school. However, it can be used purposefully by people of any age, including adult and elderly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This application features highest graphic quality, a powerful adaptive engine for the difficulty level, a database of users and statistical tools to evaluate the progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently English, French and Italian are supported, but any language can be easily supported. </description>
