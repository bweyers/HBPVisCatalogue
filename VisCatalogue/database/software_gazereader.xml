<description> GazeReader is a toolbox for a point-process derived GLM analysis of eye tracking data in Matlab (Mathworks, Nattick, MA). It was developed with the following goals in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Flexible yet well ordered integration of the steps involved in linear model specification, fitting, selection and review.&lt;br /&gt;2. Ease of use and efficiency in specifying and comparing numerous alternate models through both a graphical interface and Matlab scripting.&lt;br /&gt;3. Simple error checking and review of model fitting and procedures.&lt;br /&gt;4. The ability to display model data side by side with raw eye-tracking data along with any appropriate stimulus related background images in order to facilitate interpretation.&lt;br /&gt;5.Efficiency of numerical model fitting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Data loading, model specification, fitting and review are organized into a sequence of events, each of which is handled by a separate module in the toolbox. The graphical interface was created using the Matlab graphical user interface development environment (GUIDE).
