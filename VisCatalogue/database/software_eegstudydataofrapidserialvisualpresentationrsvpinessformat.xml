<description> Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (12Hz) Target (airplane) detection without immediate response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purpose of this study was to explore the neural basis of target detection in human brain and to compare the performance of brain-computer interface (BCI) methods in classification of target vs. non-target images. The data was acquired during a rapid serial visual presentation task which was composed of a sequential presentation of image clips in rapid succession (12/s) in 4.1-s bursts, to which subjects were to indicate whether or not the satellite image clips of London presented included a small target airplane image by making one of two button presses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This study was collected at UCSD/Swartz Center and placed into ESS version 2.02, levels 1&amp;amp;2 by Syntrogi Inc.
