<name name="Laplace Beltrami Filter on QuadEdge Meshes" nitrc="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/laplacebeltrami" />
<description> The purpose of this filter is to use the Laplace-Beltrami operator to determine surface harmonics in terms&lt;br /&gt;of PointData at each vertex. In the same way that a sound signal can be approximately characterized by a&lt;br /&gt;combination of its most significant frequency components, so can a surface be expressed as a combination&lt;br /&gt;of its surface harmonics. This filter determines the requested N most significant harmonics. </description>
