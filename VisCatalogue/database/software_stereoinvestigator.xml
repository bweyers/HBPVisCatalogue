<description> A Stereo Investigator system for stereology gives you accurate, unbiased estimates of the number, length, area, and volume of cells or biological structures in a tissue specimen. It is a key research tool that has helped lead advances in numerous areas of neuroscience including neurodegenerative diseases, neuropathy, memory, and behavior, as well as other research fields including pulmonary research, spinal cord research, and toxicology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to stereology software, a Stereo Investigator system includes any hardware you need, such as a microscope, computer, motorized stage, camera, etc., and comes with MBFâ€™s technical support for the entire system as well as research support to optimize your experimental design. </description>
