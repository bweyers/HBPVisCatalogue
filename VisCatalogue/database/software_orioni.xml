<description> ORION I is a software designed for automatic 3D morphological reconstruction of neurons. The input of a software is a 3D image stack (RAW format) representing the neuron or a sequence of 3D image stacks with the provide translation parameters to align the stacks. The output is the 3D morphological reconstruction of the neuron represented in a 3D acyclic graph as the standard SWC format. </description>
