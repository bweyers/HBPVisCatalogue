<description> INSTAR (Infant Joint Segmentation and Registration) provides a solution of accurate segmentation and registration for infant brain images, especially from birth to 1 year old, which plays an important role in many early brain development studies. &lt;br /&gt;Specifically, infant brain image segmentation or registration often encounters much more challenges than segmentation/registration of adult brain images due to the dynamic appearance change with rapid brain development. Therefore, in this software package, we included out latest joint segmentation and registration framework [1] to tackle the challenges.&lt;br /&gt;This software package was developed in the IDEA group at UNC-Chapel Hill (&lt;a href=&quot;http://bric.unc.edu/ideagroup&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;http://bric.unc.edu/ideagroup&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;[1] P.
