<description> This data-set contains all 3T MRI data used in Boekel et al., (submitted), in which we aimed to investigate the invivo test-retest reliability of several DTI derived measures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;34 healthy young subjects were scanned twice on the same day with a 3T MRI scanner in which the following data was acquired:&lt;br /&gt;- T1 weighted whole brain scan (1mm isotropic). &lt;br /&gt;- B0 weighted whole brain scan (2mm isotropic)&lt;br /&gt;- Diffusion weighted whole brain scan (2mm isotropic, 32 directions, b-value=1000, 4 repetitions)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A subset of 15 subjects were also scanned a third session on the same day, as well as in a two-week follow-up session with the same MRI protocol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full reference of the article is: &lt;br /&gt;Boekel, W., Forstmann, B. U., Keuken, M.C. (In press) A test-retest reliability analysis of diffusion measures of white matter tracts relevant for cognitive control. Psychophysiology.
