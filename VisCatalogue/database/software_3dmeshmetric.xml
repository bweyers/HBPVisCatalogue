<description> 3DMeshMetric is a visualization tool based on the VTK library.&lt;br /&gt;Its main feature is to compute and display surface-to-surface distance between two triangle meshes using user-specified uniform sampling (based on the source code of MeshValmet: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nitrc.org/projects/meshvalmet/&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;http://www.nitrc.org/projects/meshvalmet...&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;3DMeshMetric also offers all the basic tools to visualize meshes such as color, opacity, smoothing, down sampling or type of representation.&lt;br /&gt;3DMeshMetric also contains an additional tool called ModelToModelDistance that computes distances between two triangle meshes (using the VTK library). This tool can be used either as a command line tool or integrated in 3D Slicer (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slicer.org&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;http://www.slicer.org&lt;/a&gt;) as a CLI module. It is available in 3D Slicer as an extension to facilitate the download and installation process.
