<description> SegEditing is a segmentation editing tool using existing labels as references. It is useful when you would like to correct large errors with a few user interactions such as dots or rough scribbles using one or multiple reference labels of the target object. This toolbox includes an image viewer, graphical user interface, and semi-automatic algorithms for segmentation. The tool can support the following functions: Open medical images with various formats (such as mhd, hdr, nii), control intensity range in visualization, zoom in/out, show segmentation results, load and save user interactions and segmentation results, and so on. The software is developed by the IDEA group at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.med.unc.edu/bric/ideagroup&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;https://www.med.unc.edu/bric/ideagroup&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Windows operating system is required to run it. The executable file was compiled on Windows 7 (64 bit). The user interfaces and overall framework of the software were implemented in C++. Parallelization technologies were also used to speed up. </description>
