<description> W2MHS is an open source MATLAB toolbox designed for detecting and quantifying White Matter Hyperintensities(WMH) in Alzheimer’s and aging related neurological disorders.Our toolbox provides a self-sufficient set of tools for segmenting these WMHs reliably and further quantifying their burden for down-processing studies. WMHs arise as bright regions on T2-weighted FLAIR images. They reflect comorbid neural injury or cerebral vascular disease burden. Their precise detection is of interest in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with regard to its prognosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please cite the following paper upon usage of this toolbox. &lt;br /&gt;Ithapu, V., Singh, V., Lindner, C., Austin, B.
