<description> Data information:&lt;br /&gt;21 subjects were scanned 3 times (V1, V2, V3), with V1 and V2 on a scanner, V3 on another scanner in another site. Resting-state blood-oxygenation-level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI), pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL), and high-resolution 3D T1 imaging were performed under eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) conditions. Please see below for the original paper (Yuan et al., 2018) and another paper (Zhao et al. 2018).&lt;br /&gt;Yuan, L.-X. et al.
