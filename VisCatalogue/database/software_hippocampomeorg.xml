<description> The Hippocampome is a curated knowledge base of the circuitry of the hippocampus of normal adult, or adolescent, rodents at the mesoscopic level of neuronal types. Knowledge concerning dentate gyrus, CA3, CA2, CA1, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex is distilled from published evidence and is continuously updated as new information becomes available. Each reported neuronal property is documented with a pointer to, and excerpt from, relevant published evidence, such as citation quotes or illustrations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal of the Hippocampome is dense coverage of available data characterizing neuronal types. The Hippocampome is a public and free resource for the neuroscience community, and the knowledge is presented for user-friendly browsing and searching and for machine-readable downloading.
