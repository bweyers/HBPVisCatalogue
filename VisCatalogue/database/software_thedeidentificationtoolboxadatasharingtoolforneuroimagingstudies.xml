<description> The De-identification Toolbox (formerly DeID) is a Java program that users can use to remove identifying information in neuroimaging datasets. This software provides a series of user interaction wizards to allow users to select data variables to be de-identified, implements functions for auditing and validation of de-identified data, and enables the user to share the de-identified data in a single compressed package through various communication protocols. The software runs with Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems. </description>
