<description> neuroConstruct is being developed in the Silver Lab in the Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology at UCL. neuroConstruct has been designed to simplify development of complex networks of biologically realistic neurons, i.e. models incorporating dendritic morphologies and realistic cell membrane conductances. It is implemented in Java and generates script files for the NEURON and GENESIS simulators, with support for other simulation platforms (including PSICS, MOOSE and PyNN) in advanced stages of development. It uses the latest NeuroML specifications, including MorphML, ChannelML and NetworkML, and supports NeuroML v2.0.
