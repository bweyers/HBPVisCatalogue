<description> S3DL (Subject Specific Sparse Dictionary Learning) is a software tool to generate whole brain segmentation as well as lesion segmentation from multi-contrast human brain MR images. It is a patch-based method, where similarities between patches from a subject and one or more atlases are exploited to create a segmentation of the subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two parts of the tool, one to create multi-class segmentation from T1-w MR images, another to segment MS lesions from T1-w and FLAIR images. They can be used independently. In addition to the software, some training atlases and test data are provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toolbox is based on the following paper, &lt;br /&gt;S. Roy, Q. He, E. Sweeney, A. Carass, D. S. Reich, J.L. Prince, and D. L. Pham, &amp;quot;Subject-Specific Sparse Dictionary Learning for Atlas-Based Brain MRI Segmentation&amp;quot;, IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, 19(5):1598-1609, 2015.
