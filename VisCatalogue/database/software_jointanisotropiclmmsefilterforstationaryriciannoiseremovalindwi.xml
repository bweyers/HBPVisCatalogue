<name name="Joint Anisotropic LMMSE Filter for Stationary Rician noise removal in DWI" nitrc="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/jalmmse_dwi" />
<description> This module reduces Rician noise on DWI. It filters the image in the mean squared error sense using a Rician noise model. The N closest gradient directions to the direction being processed are filtered together to improve the results: the noise-free signal is seen as an n-dimensional vector which has to be estimated with the LMMSE method from a set of corrupted measurements. The covariance matrix of the noise-free vector and the cross covariance between this signal and the noise have to be estimated, which is done taking into account the image formation process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these estimations are performed as sample estimates in a &#x27;shaped neighborhood&#x27; defined by the weights extracted from the structural similarity of the voxels following the same idea as in the Non-Local Means filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This C++ code can be compiled as either a standalone (ITK required. Versions 3 and 4 are supported) or as a CLI module for 3-D Slicer (versions 3 and 4). Only &amp;quot;nhdr/nrrd&amp;quot; DWIs are supported.
