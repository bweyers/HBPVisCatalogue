<name name="Single-index Varying Coefficient Model for Functional Responses" nitrc="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/sivc" />
<description> The aim of this tool is to implement a functional analysis pipeline, for the joint analysis of functional data and clinical data, for example age, gender and disease status. SIVC consists of a functional single index for characterizing the association of functional response with covariates of interest by incorporating complex spatial-temporal correlation structure, an efficient method for spatially smoothing varying coefficient functions, an estimation method for estimating the&lt;br /&gt;spatial-temporal correlation structure, a simultaneous confidence band for quantifying the uncertainty in the estimated coefficient functions. </description>
