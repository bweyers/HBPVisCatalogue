<description> This software package contains functions that will help researchers plan how many subjects per group need to be included in an MRI-based cortical thickness study to ensure a thickness difference is detected. The package requires cortical thickness mapping and co-registration to be carried out using Freesurfer. The power analyses are implemented in the R software package. </description>
