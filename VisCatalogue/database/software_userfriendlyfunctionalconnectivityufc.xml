<name name="User Friendly Functional Connectivity - UF²C" nitrc="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/uf2c" />
<description> UF²C is an open source software developed at the Neuroimaging Laboratory at Unicamp that aims to simplify and organize functional studies in neuroimaging through clean and validated methodologies.&lt;br /&gt;The graphical user interface makes the processing and analysis options accessible for neuroscientists, with reasonable choices of default settings. UF²C allows the user to study functional connectivity both through a quantitative view that provides detailed values of average connectivity and through a spatial view that provides statistical maps that can be directly used for further analyses. All results are carefully organized in a distinct folder for each subject, and a common folder is generated with a log file reporting the quantitative results of all the analyzed subjects.&lt;br /&gt;Several UF²C modalities and tools runs combined with Statistical Parametric Mapping functions.&lt;br /&gt; Coordinator and developer&lt;br /&gt; Brunno M. de Campos, Ph.D.&lt;br /&gt; Collaborator Developer&lt;br /&gt; Raphael Fernandes Casseb, Ph.D.
