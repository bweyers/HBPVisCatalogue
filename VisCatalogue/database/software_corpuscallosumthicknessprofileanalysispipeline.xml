<name name="Corpus Callosum Thickness Profile Analysis Pipeline" nitrc="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/ccsegthickness" />
<description> An end-to-end pipeline for corpus callosum processing that provides automated midsagittal alignment, CC segmentation with a quality control tool, and thickness profile generation. Groupwise analysis is facilitated by permutation testing with FWER and FDR multiple comparison correction. Results display is facilitated by a display script that shows p-values on a 3D pipe representation of a CC. This pipeline is implemented in Python. </description>
