<description> The ImageCite Consortium is a group of image data host providers banded together with the objective to plan and implement an imaging unique identification (DOI) system across a broad set of imaging data sharing host providers. The consortium will review a proposed scheme of identification and attribution (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2016.00034&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2016.00034&lt;/a&gt;) in terms of its suitability and applicability to the needs of the community and feasibility of implementation in the various image hosting systems. Outcomes will be a conceptual plan of what can be accomplished by the repositories in the short term under current, existing development cycles (Phase 0); identification of additional future objectives that can be achieved with additional, potentially coordinated, support; and a ‘white paper’ document that documents this identifier vision that can be circulated to additional resource providers in order to attempt to gain even wider adoption. </description>
