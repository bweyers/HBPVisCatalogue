<description> Group-fused multiple-graphical lasso cobined with stability selection (GMGLASS) is a software toolbox that can be employed to simultaneously estimate both individual- and group-level functional networks from 2 groups.&lt;br /&gt;The software:&lt;br /&gt; (1) Reads time series from 2 groups of subjects;&lt;br /&gt; (2) Randomly subsamples data 100 times to estimate stability with stability &lt;br /&gt; selection;&lt;br /&gt; (3) Group-fused multiple-graphical lasso is applied with two hyper-parameters: alpha and beta;&lt;br /&gt; (4) Appropriate ranges of hyper-parameters are chosen for achieving stability selection;&lt;br /&gt; (5) Both individual- and group-level functional networks can be estimated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The method is described in the following paper:&lt;br /&gt; Xiaoyun Liang, David N.
