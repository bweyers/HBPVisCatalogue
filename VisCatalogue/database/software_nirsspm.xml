<description> NIRS-SPM is a SPM and MATLAB-based software package for statistical analysis of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) signals, developed at the Bio Imaging Signal Processing (BISP) lab. at KAIST in Korea. Based on the general linear model (GLM), and Sun&#x27;s tube formula / Lipschitz-Killing curvature (LKC) based expected Euler characteristics, NIRS-SPM not only provides activation maps of oxy-, deoxy-, and total-hemoglobin, but also allows for super-resolution activation localization. Additional features, including a wavelet-minimum description length detrending algorithm and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) estimation without hypercapnia, were implemented in the NIRS-SPM software package. </description>
