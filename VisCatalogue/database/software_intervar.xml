<description> InterVar is a bioinformatics software tool for clinical interpretation of genetic variants by the ACMG/AMP 2015 guideline. The input to InterVar is an annotated file generated from ANNOVAR, while the output of InterVar is the classification of variants into &#x27;Benign&#x27;, &#x27;Likely benign&#x27;, &#x27;Uncertain significance&#x27;, &#x27;Likely pathogenic&#x27; and &#x27;Pathogenic&#x27;, together with detailed evidence code. InterVar is a command-line-driven software written in Python and can be used as a standalone application on a variety of operating systems—includingWindows, Linux, and MacOS—where Python is installed. wInterVar is a web server, which offers a graphical user interface for InterVar. </description>
