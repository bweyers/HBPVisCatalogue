<description> This toolbox is an EEGLAB plugin for performing Measure Projection Analysis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Measure Projection Analysis (MPA) is a novel probabilistic multi-subject inference method that overcomes EEG Independent Component (IC) clustering issues by abandoning the notion of distinct IC clusters. Instead, it searches voxel by voxel for brain regions having event-related IC process dynamics that exhibit statistically significant consistency across subjects and/or sessions as quantified by the values of various EEG measures. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Local-mean EEG measure values are then assigned to all such locations based on a probabilistic model of IC localization error and inter-subject anatomical and functional differences.
