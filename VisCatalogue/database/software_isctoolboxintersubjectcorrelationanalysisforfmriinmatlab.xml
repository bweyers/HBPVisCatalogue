<name name="isc-toolbox: Inter-subject correlation analysis for fMRI in Matlab" nitrc="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/isc-toolbox" />
<description> This Matlab toolbox performs inter-subject correlation (ISC) based analysis of fMRI data and includes a GUI for the visualization of the resulting thresholded statistical maps. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toolbox contains functions to carry out various ISC based analysis such as mean, frequency band, time window and phase synchronization ISC analysis. All analyses can be run from a GUI. Isc-toolbox includes also automated support for Slurm/SGE based grid environments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A set of visualization tools - particularly designed for ISC analyses - are integrated to the GUI. Visualization tools contain functionalities to which standard functional neuroimaging packages are difficult to adapt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reference: J.-P. Kauppi, J. Pajula J and J.
