<description> PySurfer is a Python based program for visualization and interaction with cortical surface representations of neuroimaging data from Freesurfer. It extends Mayavi’s powerful visualization engine with a high-level interface for working with MRI and MEG data. PySurfer offers both a command-line interface designed to broadly replicate Freesurfer’s Tksurfer program as well as a Python library for writing scripts to efficiently explore complex datasets.
