<description> Multi Atlas Skull Stripping (MASS) [ARAD2013], is a software package designed for robust and accurate brain extraction, applicable for both individual as well as large population studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MASS is implemented as a Unix command-line tool. It is fully automatic and easy to use â€” users input an image, and MASS will output the extracted brain and the associated brain mask. </description>
