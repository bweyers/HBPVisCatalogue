<description> The Online Brain Atlas Reconciliation Tool (OBART) aims to provide a quantitative solution to the so-called neuroanatomical nomenclature problem by comparing overlap relations between regions defined as spatial entities in different MRI-based human brain atlases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool currently allows users to: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Explore the regions defined by individual atlases, choose individual regions to view in 2D projection images, and list other similar regions and the degree to which they overlap the chosen region&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Compare two atlases using a graph based visualization to understand &amp;quot;higher-order&amp;quot; neuroanatomical correspondences&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Simultaneously their own binary mask image based on ROIs from multiple atlases. This requires the user to upload an image registered to MNI-305 space, and returns a table of overlapping ROIs. </description>
