<description> Mesh-based Monte Carlo, or MMC, is a Monte Carlo (MC) solver for photon migration in 3D turbid media. Different from existing MC software designed for layered (such as MCML) or voxel-based media (such as MMC or tMCimg), MMC can represent a complex domain using a tetrahedral mesh. This not only greatly improves the accuracy of the solutions when modeling objects with smooth/complex boundaries, but also gives an efficient way to sample the problem domain to use less memory. The current version of MMC support multi-threaded programming and can give a almost proportional speed-up when using multiple CPU cores.
