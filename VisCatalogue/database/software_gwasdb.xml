<description> The database provides following functions: &lt;br /&gt;(i) In addition to all the TASs attained genome-wide significance (P-value &amp;lt; 5 x 10-8), we manually curated the TASs that are marginally significant (P-value &amp;lt; 10-3) by looking into the supplementary materials of each original publication; &lt;br /&gt;(ii) Extensive functional annotations and predictions for those TASs across multiple domains; &lt;br /&gt;(iii) Furthermore, we have manually mapped those TASs by phenotype according to Disease Ontology (DO), Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) for easy access. &lt;br /&gt;(iv) Besides the SNP-trait association, we also collect SNP-Drug Response data. &lt;br /&gt;(v) Comprehensive and interactive user interface to facilitate the GWAS research. </description>
