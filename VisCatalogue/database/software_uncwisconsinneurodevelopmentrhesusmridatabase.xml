<description> This is a macaque brain MRI database characterizing the normal postnatal macaque brain development. This longitudinal primate database was acquired from a cohort of healthy macaque monkeys ranging from a few week olds up to 3-year-old adolescents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each scan consists of structural (both T1 and T2) and diffusion MRI. T1 and T2 are provided as NRRD format in the original scanner space as well as in a common atlas space where they are rigidly aligned. Diffusion MRI is provided as raw diffusion weighted images. In addition, pre-processing was performed including motion and eddy current distortion correction on the diffusion weighted MR and tensors were calculated with diffusion property maps (FA, MD, Baseline and iDWI).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For further information, see also Young JT et al. The UNC-Wisconsin Rhesus Macaque Neurodevelopment Database: A Structural MRI and DTI Database of Early Postnatal Development. Frontiers in Neuroscience. 2017 Feb 2;11:292â€“11.
