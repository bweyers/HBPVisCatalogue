<description> Connectivity Orientation Spherical distribution Tool (COST) - This tool implements the method from the paper &amp;quot;Efficient, Graph-based White Matter Connectivity from Orientation Distribution Functions via Multi-directional Graph Propagation,&amp;quot; Proc. of SPIE 2011; 7962(79620S):1-8. However, with it we also seek to modify the method into a minimum cost-based approach and eventually test it on applications. </description>
