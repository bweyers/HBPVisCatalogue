<name name="SchizConnect: Large-Scale Schizophrenia Neuroimaging Data Mediation &amp; Federation" nitrc="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/schizconnect" />
<description> Large-scale data sharing and integration is needed to further the state-of-the-art schizophrenia research, but is presently not possible due to practical limitations in the way in which data are being shared. SchizConnect is a data mediation and integration resource to overcome these limitations in a low-cost manner and deliver a web portal to interact with the federated databases.
