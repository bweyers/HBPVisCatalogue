<description> SSPM represents Spatial Statistical Parametric Mapping.This package includes two tools presently: MAGEE and FADTTS. &lt;br /&gt;MAGEE represents the Multiscale Adaptive Generalized Estimating Equation. It was developed specifically for analyzing multivariate neuroimaging data in 3-dimensional volume (or on 2-dimensional surface) from longitudinal neuroimaging studies. &lt;br /&gt;FADTTS represents Functional Analysis of Diffusion Tensor Tract Statistics. The aim of this tool is to implement a functional analysis pipeline, for delineating the structure of the variability of multiple diffusion properties along major white matter fiber bundles and their association with a set of covariates of interest, in various diffusion tensor imaging studies. </description>
