<description> This software provides algorithms for the reconstruction of raw MR data. In&lt;br /&gt;particular, it supports the reconstruction of accelerated data acquisitions&lt;br /&gt;where k-space is subsampled and the Fourier domain encoding is complemented&lt;br /&gt;by temporal encoding, spatial encoding, or and/or a constrained&lt;br /&gt;reconstruction. This library of functions provides a number of&lt;br /&gt;reconstruction algorithms that accurately employ advanced MR imaging methods&lt;br /&gt;including: UNFOLD; parallel imaging methods such as SENSE and GRAPPA;&lt;br /&gt;Homodyne processing of partial-Fourier data, and gradient field&lt;br /&gt;inhomogeneity correction (gradwarp); EPI Nyquist Ghost correction and&lt;br /&gt;ramp-sampling gridding. The target audience is research groups who may be&lt;br /&gt;interested in exploring or employing advanced MR reconstruction techniques,&lt;br /&gt;but don&#x27;t have the necessary expertise in-house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inquires may be directed to: ncigt-imaging-toolkit -at- bwh.harvard.edu </description>
