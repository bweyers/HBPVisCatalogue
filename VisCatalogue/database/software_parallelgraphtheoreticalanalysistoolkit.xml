<description> PAGANI Toolkit is a complete software package which can implement all process including brain network construction and network analysis for fMRI data. A CPU-GPU hybrid framework is adopted to make PAGANI Toolkit faster in network analysis.Our PAGANI Toolkit has low hardware requirements for only a PC with a CUDA available GPU. Compared with PC clusters, itâ€™s easier to set up and has comparable or better performance for human brain network analysis. </description>
