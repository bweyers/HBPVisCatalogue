<description> Primatologist is a BrainVISA toolbox dedicated to the processing of structural MRIs acquired in macaques (for now) and more generally in non-human primates (NHP, in the future).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its main component is a modular segmentation pipeline for T1 or T2-weighted MRIs based on a generative model of intensities, with NHP-specific preprocessing tools. It allows segmenting the brain into 17 anatomical regions. The results can then easily be processed with Morphologist to extract meshes of the brain and sulci.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes advantages of the features of BrainVISA including an ontological organization of the data, the possibility to easily distribute processing on a multicore workstation or on a computing cluster, and easy quality checking with dedicated viewers.
