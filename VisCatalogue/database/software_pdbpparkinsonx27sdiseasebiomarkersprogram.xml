<description> The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Parkinson&#x27;s Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) was developed to accelerate the discovery of promising new diagnostic and progression biomarkers for Parkinson&#x27;s Disease. The PDBP is focused on promoting the discovery of biomarker candidates for early detection and measurement of disease progression. The PDBP will coordinate the efforts of multiple stakeholders through a common data management resource and web portal. The PDBP will serve as a multi-faceted platform for:&lt;br /&gt; - Integrating existing biomarker efforts&lt;br /&gt; - Standardizing data collection and management across these efforts&lt;br /&gt; - Accelerating the discovery of new biomarkers&lt;br /&gt; - Fostering and expanding collaborative opportunities for all stakeholders. </description>
