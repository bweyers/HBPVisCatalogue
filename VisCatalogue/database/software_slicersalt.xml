<description> SlicerSALT (Shape AnaLysis Toolbox, SALT) continues the maintenance, expansion, validation and dissemination of the SPHARM-PDM (SPherical HARMonics Point Distributed Models) shape analysis toolbox. It is distributed as a tailor-made lighter version of 3DSlicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPHARM-PDM is a popular open-source tool that has been used by the biomedical research community to analyze the morphology of anatomical structures. SlicerSALT will maintain the core functionalities of SPHARM-PDM, as well as dramatically extending the toolbox into a general shape analysis toolbox. Novel, robust and validated methodologies will provide support for objects of non-spherical topology, skeletal models, four-dimensional models, and study-specific optimal model correspondence. SALT is being tested three application case scenarios to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed methods. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SlicerSALT will continue providing excellent documentation, community resources, and user support.
