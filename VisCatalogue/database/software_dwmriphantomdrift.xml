<description> This is a set of DWMRI acquisitions of two different diffusion phantoms with interspersed images with a b-value of zero. These were used to analyzed the affects of temporal scanner drift. There are 5 unique corrections (and associated corrected DWMRI data) that was applied to this data to correct for temporal/spatial drift over the course of each scan. The corrections were implemented in MATLAB. </description>
