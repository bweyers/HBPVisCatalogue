<name name="Local Binary Pattern Analysis Tools for MR Brain Images" nitrc="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mri_lbptop" />
<description> The packaged tools perform Local Binary Pattern on Three Orthogonal Planes(LBP-TOP) analysis on MR brain images. One can use them to extract LBP texture features for machine learning applications or other advance analysis. LBP-TOP mapping programs written by Java are including in this package. The output is the histogram describing the brain morphology. </description>
