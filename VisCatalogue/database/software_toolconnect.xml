<description> ToolConnect is an open source software for the functional connectivity analysis of in vitro neural networks. In the current version, ToolConnect implements correlation- (cross-correlation, partial-correlation) and information theory (joint entropy, transfer entropy) based algorithms, as well as useful and practical add-ons to visualize functional connectivity graphs and extract some topological features derived from graph theory. </description>
