<name name="Diffusion Tractography with Kalman Filter" nitrc="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/ukftractography" />
<description> We present a framework which uses an unscented Kalman filter for performing tractography. At each point on the fiber the most consistent direction is found as a mixture of previous estimates and of the local model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to expand the framework and to implement new fiber representations for it. Currently it is possible to tract fibers using two different 1-, 2-, or 3-tensor methods. Both methods use a mixture of Gaussian tensors. One limits the diffusion ellipsoids to a cylindrical shape (the second and third eigenvalue are assumed to be identical) and the other one uses a full tensor representation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The project is written in C++. It could be used both as a Slicer3 module and as a standalone commandline application. </description>
