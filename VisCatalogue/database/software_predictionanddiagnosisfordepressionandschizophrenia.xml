<name name="Prediction and Diagnosis for Depression and Schizophrenia" nitrc="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/zhangxw" />
<description> Researches have shown that Depression and Schizophrenia is a dynamic, nonstatic phenomenon. Accordingly, it appears to be more important to prevent the worsening of these diseases over time, and early assessment and prediction for these diseases can play an important role in achieving early intervention and reducing the incidence of them. In our research, we plan to explore the tool and resource about how to predict Depression and Schizophrenia based on Demographics and physiological information(EEG, ERPs, Genetics, MRI, fMRI, etc.). Ultimately, we hope this research can lay the theoretical foundation for the application of prediction for Depression and Schizophrenia. </description>
