<description> MASS [1] is a software package designed for robust and accurate brain extraction, applicable for both individual as well as large population studies. MASS is implemented as a Unix command-line tool. It is fully automatic and easy to use â€” users input an image, and MASS will output the extracted brain and the associated brain mask. </description>
