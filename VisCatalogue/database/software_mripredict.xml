<description> MRI Predict is an SPM toolbox, FSL-flavour lib and R package to easily predict an outcome (e.g. whether the patient will respond to a treatment, or whether the patient has one or another disorder) from sMRI scans. The model may include covariates, and the software conducts both cross-validation of the model and fitting for its use with new VBM data in other dimensions. </description>
