<name name="C8: Corpus Callosum Computations" nitrc="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/c8c8" />
<description> C8 is a small, stand-alone MatLab toolbox that measures sagittal cross-section thickness and area of the human corpus callosum from high-resolution T1 in vivo MR images. C8 takes as input affine normalized white matter segmentations derived from high-resolution (in-plane) T1 images and outputs both regional callosal thicknesses in three different formats and geometrically-defined regional areas in three different configurations. It is a small package that is easily configurable and modifiable and it measures callosa at the rate of several per minute.
