<description> The NYU CSC TestRetest resource includes EPI-images of 25 participants gathered during rest as well as anonymized anatomical images of the same participants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resting-state fMRI images were collected on several occasions: &lt;br /&gt;1. the first resting-state scan in a scan session&lt;br /&gt;2. 5-11 months after the first resting-state scan&lt;br /&gt;3. about 30 (&amp;lt; 45) minutes after 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each scan occasion is released as a new version release of the resource. Make sure to check all releases to get all files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Data use is unrestricted, but users should reference our original publications and NITRC (see Documentations).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Caution: Participants here are part of the NewYork_a contribution to the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project.
