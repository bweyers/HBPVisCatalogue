<description> Cloud Based Interactive Visualization of Tractography Brain Connectome (CIVILITY) is an interactive visualization tool of brain connectome in the web.&lt;br /&gt;CIVILITY is a web application and has mainly 2 components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-CIVILITY-visualization ; front end of the application. This is a circle plot of the brain connectivity using the method of visualization : Hierarchical Edge Bundling. The graphic visualization of the brain connectivity is generated using Data Driven Documents (D3.js).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-CIVILITY-tractography ; analysis pipeline. The analysis of the brain connectome is computed with a probabilistic tractography method (FSL tools : bepostx and probtrackx2) using surfaces as seeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CIVILITY performs the brain connectivity analysis in remote computing grids where the CIVILITY-tractography pipeline is deployed. CIVILITY uses clusterpost (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NIRALUser/clusterpost&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;https://github.com/NIRALUser/clusterpost&lt;/a&gt;) to submit the jobs to the computing grid. The front end of CIVILITY submits tasks to clusterpost and retrieves results when they are finished.
