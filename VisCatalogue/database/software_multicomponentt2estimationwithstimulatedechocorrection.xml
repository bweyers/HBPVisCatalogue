<name name="Multicomponent T2 estimation with stimulated echo correction" nitrc="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/multi_t2" />
<description> This tool is designed to assist users in the estimation of multiple relaxation components from MRI T2 weighted spin-echo data such as that produced by a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence. This problem is important to study myelin content in white matter diseases such as multiple sclerosis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stimulated echoes arising from non-ideal flip angles are accounted for using the Extended Phase Graph (EPG) algorithm. The distribution is modelled as a small number of discrete components and a Bayesian estimation algorithm is provided to determine the weights and locations of the components as well as the actual flip angle. This algorithm outperforms iterative gradient descent based approaches. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The details of the algorithm are given the following paper:&lt;br /&gt;Layton, K. J. et al.
