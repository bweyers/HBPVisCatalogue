<description> The VIEWPixx is a complete display toolbox which has been conceived specifically to replace CRTs in vision science labs. The VIEWPixx features high-performance industrial LCD glass, and a panel controller which has been custom designed to support vision research.Our innovative LED backlight design features superior display uniformity, and a wide color gamut exceeding that of any CRT. In addition, it includes an array of peripherals which often need to be synchronized to video during an experiment, including a stereo audio stimulator, a button box port for precise reaction-time measurement, triggers for electrophysiology equipment, and even a complete analog I/O subsystem. Because we implemented the video controller and peripheral control on the same circuit board, you can now successfully synchronize all of your subject I/O to video refresh with microsecond precision.
