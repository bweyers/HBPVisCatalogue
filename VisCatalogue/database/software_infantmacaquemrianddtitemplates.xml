<description> This is a multi-mode (T1w and DTI) brain template of monkeys during late infancy based on longitudinal data (from 6 months to 16 months), which will help spatial normalization, voxel-based and tract-based analyses in non-human primates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots efforts were made to ensure the quality:&lt;br /&gt;1) we manually skull-striped brains for all T1w&amp;amp;DTI data (120+ brains). The time-consuming procedure guaranteed more accurate brain extraction than automatic methods (3dSkullStrip or BET).&lt;br /&gt;2) We had tested different methods, and the best ones were chosen to build the T1w (by ANTS) and DTI (by DTI-TK) templates.&lt;br /&gt;3) We also made high quality template-related files, including parcellation maps, tissue probability maps, inferior cingulum mask for TBSS, and templates for each time point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detailed information about monkeys and methods of building templates can be found in:&lt;br /&gt;Liu,C, et al. &amp;quot;Rhesus monkey brain development during late infancy and the effect of phencyclidine: a longitudinal MRI and DTI study.&amp;quot; NeuroImage (2015).
