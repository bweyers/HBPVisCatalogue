<name name="The EBDS Infant DTI Fiber Atlases" nitrc="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/uncebds_neodti" />
<description> Neonatal and 1-2 year old DTI fiber atlases for studies of brain development at birth to 2 years of age from the UNC Early Brain Development Studies (EBDS) group and the NIRAL (Neuro Image Research and Analysis Laboratory)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Infant DTI atlases with a comprehensive set of template fibers for semi-automatic tract based analysis that represents a typically developing human brain during the first few weeks up to 2 years of life. To the best of our knowledge, this the first such population atlases with this magnitude of quality and sample size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These resources enable widespread application of a set of template fibers for atlas based along-tract analysis supporting an adequate and reliable analysis of DTI in newborns in both practice and in clinical research settings and address a critical gap in the current research community.
