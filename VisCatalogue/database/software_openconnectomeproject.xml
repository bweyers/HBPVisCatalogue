<description> The Open Connectome Project (OCP: openconnectomeproject.org) provides access to high resolution neuroanatomical images that can be used to explore connectomes. We also provide programmatic access to this data for human and machine annotation, with a long-term goal of reconstructing the neural circuits comprising an entire brain. This project aims to bring the most state-of-the-art scientific data in the world to the hands of anybody with internet access, so collectively, we can begin to unravel connectomes. </description>
