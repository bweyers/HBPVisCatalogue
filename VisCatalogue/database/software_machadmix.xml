<description> MaCH-Admix is an extension to MaCH for faster and more flexible imputaiton, especially in admixed populations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has incorporated a novel piecewise reference selection method to create reference panels tailored for target individual(s). This reference selection method generates better imputation quality in shorter running time. MaCH-Admix also separates model parameter estimation from imputation. The separation allows users to perform imputation with standard reference panels + pre-calibrated parameters in a data independent fashion. Alternatively, if one works with study-specific reference panels, or isolated target population, one has the option to simultaneously estimate these model parameters while performing imputation. MaCH-Admix has included many other useful options and supports VCF input files. All existing MaCH documentation applies to MaCH-Admix. </description>
