<description> GesTr is a cross platform, open source gesture tracking program. You launch it from the web, and use it to streamline the way you communicate with the computer. It allows for a more natural method of issuing commands than with keyboard shortcuts or GUI buttons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GesTr supports simple XML files to customize recognized gestures and their corresponding actions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GesTr also has experimental support for the Wii Remote used with an infrared pen as an alternative input device. </description>
