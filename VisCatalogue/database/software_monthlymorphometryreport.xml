<description> The Monthly Morphometry Report (MMR) is designed to be a quick, high-level synopsis of the volumetric literature, compiled on a monthly basis. We seek to represent the corpus of published findings in a suscinct and common format, to ease human interpretation of ths vast set of measures that are being reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, monthly PUBMED reports of potential volumetric publications in humans are identified, and human curators then summarise these abstracts into a standard report format. In the future, we hope to add automation to the curation process and index more complete full-text content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This project is HIGHLY alpha in its design and should be considered only a &#x27;work in progress&#x27;. Enter at your own risk, or, volunteer to help! </description>
