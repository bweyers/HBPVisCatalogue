<name name="hippocampus subregional masks based on gray matter volume covariance" nitrc="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/hippo_gmvc" />
<description> The masks were generated by parcellating the human hippocampus with two independent datasets, each of which consisted of 198 T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging images of healthy young subjects. The method was based on gray matter volume (GMV) covariance, which was quantified by a bivariate voxel-to-voxel linear correlation approach, as well as a multivariate masked independent component analysis approach. </description>
