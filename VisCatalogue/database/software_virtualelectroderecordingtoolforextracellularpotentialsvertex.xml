<description> The Virtual Electrode Recording Tool for EXtracellular potentials (VERTEX) is a Matlab tool for simulating extracellular potential recordings in spiking neural network (SNN) models. VERTEX is designed to facilitate the simulation of extracellular potentials generated by activity in SNNs; in particular, spatially-organised networks containing thousands or hundreds of thousands of neurons. VERTEXâ€™s interface and model specification options were designed with this particular task in mind. It is therefore less flexible than other neural simulators, but the limited scope has allowed us to simplify the user interface so that a simulation can be specified simply by setting some parameters and run using a few function calls. </description>
