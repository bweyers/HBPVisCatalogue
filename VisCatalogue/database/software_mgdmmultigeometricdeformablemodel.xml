<description> MGDM is an efficient level set framework for multi-object segmentation. Its representation inherently prevents overlaps and gaps and it readily preserves object topology and object relationships. MGDM is efficient, storing only a fixed number of functions for any number of objects, and therefore scales well to segmentation problems with many classes and large images. It&#x27;s representation also avoids some instabilities in other multi-class level set methods. MGDM is cross-platform; MATLAB wrappers, Java source and API are provided, with MIPAV plugins forthcoming. </description>
