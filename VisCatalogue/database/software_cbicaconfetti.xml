<description> Confetti is a method for automated identification of white matter tracts of interest in a consistent and comparable manner over a large group of subjects without drawing the inclusion and exclusion regions of interest (ROI), facilitating an easy correspondence between different subjects, as well as providing a representation that is robust to edema, mass effect, and tract infiltration.&lt;br /&gt;Confetti includes three main steps: (1) Connectivity signature generation for fibers, (2) Clustering of fibers using a mixture of multinomials (MNs) clustering method and Expectation-Maximization (EM) optimization framework, (3) Extraction of predefined white matter tracts. </description>
