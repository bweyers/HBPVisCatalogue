<description> Diffusion-Oriented Tract Segmentation (DOTS) is a fast, scalable tool developed at the Johns Hopkins University to automatically segment the major anatomical fiber tracts within the human brain from clinical quality diffusion tensor MR imaging. With an atlas-based Markov Random Field representation, DOTS directly estimates the tract probabilities, bypassing tractography and associated issues. Overlapping and crossing fibers are modeled and DOTS can also handle white matter lesions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOTS is released as a plug-in for the MIPAV software package and as a module for the JIST pipeline environment. They are therefore cross-platform and compatible with a wide variety of file formats.
