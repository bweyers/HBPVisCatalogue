<description> ConWhAt - a library for connectome-based white matter atlas analysis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conventional approaches to atlasing white matter structures follow a tract-based ontology: they assign locations in stereotaxic space to a relatively small number of gross white matter tracts from the classical neuroanatomy literature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, they aren&#x27;t particularly well-suited to network-based descriptions of brain organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Connectome-based white matter atlases take a different approach: they follow a connectivity-based ontology. The idea here is rather than following the classical anatomical tract nomenclature, to label white matter voxels according to the grey matter regions that their constituent fibers interconnect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefit of this approach is that a scientist/clinician/citizen can take a set of (standard space) coordinates, or a nifti-format ROI mask such as a binary lesion map, and straightforwardly query which grey matter region pairs (i.e. connectome-edges) have fibers passing through those locations. </description>
