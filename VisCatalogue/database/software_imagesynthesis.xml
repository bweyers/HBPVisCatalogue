<description> The Image Synthesis Tools are a collection of software tools developed for medical image synthesis of typically magnetic resonance (MR) brain images, however, the approaches have been used to create computed tomography (CT) images from MR input. The goal of image synthesis is to recover MR images with a desired optimal contrast for further processing by either registration or segmentation. Image synthesis can be thought of as a new image restoration technique that recovers images with both the desired tissue contrast and a normalized intensity profile. </description>
