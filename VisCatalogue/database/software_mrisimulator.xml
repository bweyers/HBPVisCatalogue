<description> The Psychology Software Tools MRI Simulator provides a realistic approximation of an actual MRI scanner to allow habituation and training of participants in an environment less daunting than a real scanner. Special populations such as children, the elderly, and psychiatric patients, are often prone to claustrophobia and anxiety in the bore of a magnet, and consequently have a much higher rate of terminating the experiment or scan session before its completion. Some centers that have dealt with these populations estimate a 50%-80% failure rate. With the use of the MRI Simulator this failure rate can often be reduced below 5%, improving cost effectiveness.
