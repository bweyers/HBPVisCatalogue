<name name="RNcut: functional brain networks parcellation" nitrc="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/rncut" />
<description> The RNcut software freely disseminated below can be used for parcellating functional brain networks with resting-state BOLD fMRI datasets. This software package represents the improved version of conventional Ncut with two added regularization terms, smoothing term Ev and small-patch removal term Ep. The software package can generate robust and homogeneous functional parcellation of not only adult but also neonate brain networks. </description>
