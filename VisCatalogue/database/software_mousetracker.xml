<description> MouseTracker is a free, user-friendly software package that allows researchers to record and analyze real-time hand movements en route to responses on the screen (via the coordinates of an MR-safe mouse, trackball, or sensor). By looking at how the hand settles into a response alternative--and how it may be partially pulled toward other alternatives--researchers glean information about real-time mental processing. It&#x27;s like opening up a single reaction time into a continuous stream of rich cognitive output. Experiments can incorporate images, letter strings, and sounds. Once recorded, participants&#x27; mouse trajectories can be visualized, averaged, and explored, and measures of curvature, complexity, velocity, acceleration, and angle can be computed. Precise characterizations of mouse trajectories&#x27; temporal and spatial dynamics are available, and these can shed light on a variety of important empirical questions across psychology, neuroscience, and beyond.
