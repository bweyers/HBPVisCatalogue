<description> Non-invasive scalp measurements of electric potentials (EEG) [as well as magnetic fields (MEG)] can be used for estimating the electric neuronal activity distribution (current density vector field) on the cortex. The methods used here are LORETA, standardized LORETA (sLORETA), and exact LORETA (eLORETA).&lt;br /&gt;Time series of cortical electric neuronal activity computed with LORETA can be used for estimating intracortical functional and effective connectivity. A collection of new methods are included here, especially well-suited for signals from these tomographies:&lt;br /&gt;1. Lagged coherence and lagged phase synchronization.&lt;br /&gt;2. Dynamic intracortical connectivity in terms of senders, hubs, and receivers.&lt;br /&gt;3. Partial coherence fields.&lt;br /&gt;4. Isolated effective coherence.&lt;br /&gt;5. Functional ICA (in the sense of functional data analysis) for discovering generalized functional connectivity across space, frequency, and time. &lt;br /&gt;All these methods and much more are programmed and available in the alpha LORETA-KEY software package.
