<description> This dataset provides deidentified imaging data for 5 subjects from an imaging study designed to image the lymphatic system non-invasively using MRI. The associated data was published as a part of an article in Elife (&amp;quot;Human and nonhuman primate meninges harbor lymphatic vessels that can be visualized noninvasively by MRI&amp;quot;) and publicized by the NIH Director as a part of his blog (&lt;a href=&quot;https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2017/10/17/new-imaging-approach-reveals-lymph-system-in-brain/&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2017/10/17...&lt;/a&gt;). </description>
