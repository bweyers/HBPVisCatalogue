<description> The CARE Consortium endeavors to provide necessary infrastructure and scientific expertise to study concussion. Together, we are united in our goal to gain a better understanding of the neurobiopsychosocial nature of concussive injury and recovery in order to ultimately enhance the safety and health of our student-athletes, service members, youth sports participants and the broader public.
