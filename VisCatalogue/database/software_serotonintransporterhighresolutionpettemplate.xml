<name name="Serotonin Transporter HighResolution PET Template" nitrc="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/ki-5htt" />
<description> This PET template is the result of a recent study where we designed and validated an user-independent approach for a detailed in vivo quantification of serotonin transporter (5-HTT) availability in the human brainstem using a template-based approach. &lt;br /&gt;The template was generated with 3T-MR images and parametric binding potential (BPND) [11C]MADAM images of ten healthy subjects. Afterward on this template 5 brainstem regions of interest (Dorsal, Median and Caudal Raphe, Ventral Midbrain and Superior Colliculi) were delineated with a 3D Erosion approach. </description>
