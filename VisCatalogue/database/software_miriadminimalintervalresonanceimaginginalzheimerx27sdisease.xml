<description> The MIRIAD dataset is a database of volumetric MRI brain-scans of 46 Alzheimer&#x27;s sufferers and 23 healthy elderly people. Many scans were collected of each participant at intervals from 2 weeks to 2 years, the study was designed to investigate the feasibility of using MRI as an outcome measure for clinical trials of Alzheimer&#x27;s treatments. It includes a total of 708 scans and should be of particular interest for work on longitudinal biomarkers and image analysis.
