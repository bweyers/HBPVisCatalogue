<description> Neo is a package for representing electrophysiology data in Python, together with support for reading a wide range of neurophysiology file formats, including Spike2, NeuroExplorer, AlphaOmega, Axon, Blackrock, Plexon, Tdt, and support for writing to a subset of these formats plus non-proprietary formats including HDF5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal of Neo is to improve interoperability between Python tools for analyzing, visualizing and generating electrophysiology data (such as OpenElectrophy, Elephant, G-node, Helmholtz, PyNN) by providing a common, shared object model. In order to be as lightweight a dependency as possible, Neo is deliberately limited to represention of data, with no functions for data analysis or visualization.
