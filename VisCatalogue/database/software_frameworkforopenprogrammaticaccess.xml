<description> The Framework for Open Programmatic Access (FOPA) aims to provide a standardized framework for communication and data exchange between medical imaging applications, with particular focus on neuroimaging technologies. FOPA is an attempt to design and implement a common protocol for network and command line communication with either file-system or imbedded data structures. Initial reference implementations will support interoperability between ITK, VTK, and Java platforms. Contributions are welcome from other neuroimaging development communities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This project is an open community effort under the BSD license. </description>
