<description> Nitime is a library for time-series analysis of data from neuroscience experiments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains a core of numerical algorithms for time-series analysis both in the time and spectral domains, a set of container objects to represent time-series, and auxiliary objects that expose a high level interface to the numerical machinery and make common analysis tasks easy to express with compact and semantically clear code. </description>
