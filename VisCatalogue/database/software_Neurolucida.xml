<description> Neurolucida is a powerful tool for creating and analyzing realistic, meaningful, and quantifiable neuron reconstructions from microscope images. Perform detailed morphometric analysis of neurons, such as: the number of dendrites, axons, nodes, synapses, and spines the length, width, and volume of dendrites and axons, area and volume of the soma, and the complexity and extension of neurons. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mbfbioscience.com/neurolucida&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;http://www.mbfbioscience.com/neurolucida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Researchers have reconstructed and analyzed tens of thousands of neurons using Neurolucida, leading to advances in areas of neuroscience including neurodegenerative diseases, neuropathy, memory, and behavior, and advances in research fields such as ophthalmology. </description>
