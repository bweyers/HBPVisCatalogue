# Used Ontolgies

We plan to adjust The Software Ontology (SWO) (https://github.com/allysonlister/swo) by adding core elements of the VISO-Ontology (https://github.com/viso-ontology).

# Editing Process for Catalogue Content

New software to be added to the catalogue must be described in XML. The corresponding schema is defined in HBPVisCatalogue/VisCatalogue/software/viscat_software.xsd.
